Documentation in progress forever...

Check out the examples, then hope that one day, documentation will magically appear. 🪄

Take a look at the models one, I'm proud of this one even though it's still under development.

If you have any feature ideas, feel free to create issues on GitHub.

## Overview

To gain a deeper knowledge of computer architecture, networking and how the CPU works at the instruction level, I wanted to build projects in Assembly, so I decided to write a server library.

The goal of this library was to provide a thorough yet simple API to allow developers to write exciting Assembly projects with a webserver without spending months building the underlying webserver and network operations.

After one year and ~25,000 lines of Assembly code, we are still far away from a production ready state, and I decided to move away from a library to an actual project because it's far more interesting. Because, I am always going way too far in project ideas, I've decided to create a cloud platform in x86 to compete (lol) against AWS, GCP, Azure and so on. More on that later, so watch this space.

And because apparently, now, it has to be mentioned, absolutely no AI was used, but this project probably served to train AI :)
