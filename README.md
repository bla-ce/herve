# Herve

Documentation in progress forever...

Check out the examples, then hope that one day, documentation will magically appear. 🪄

Take a look at the models one, I'm proud of this one even though it's still under development.

If you have any feature ideas, feel free to create issues on GitHub.

## Overview

### What is Herve?

Herve is a high-performance HTTP Server Library written entirely in Assembly for x86 systems.

### Why Herve has been built and why would you use it?

To gain a deeper knowledge of computer architecture, networking and how the CPU works at the instruction level, I wanted to build projects in Assembly.

But let's be real, spending hours to just write basic functions like `to_string` or `strlen` is not the most exciting or rewarding thing.

The goal of this library is to provide a thorough yet simple API to allow developers to write exciting Assembly projects with a webserver without spending months building the underlying webserver and network operations.

No, I want developers to be able to spin up a webserver with 70 lines of Assembly and focus on the rest of the project.

After one year and ~24,000 lines of Assembly code, we are still far away from a production ready state, but we'll get there.
